## Project Description

The goal of this project is to combine everything you have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so you can see how it all works together. For this project, you will start with this messy data set [Shark Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks). 
You will need to register on [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com), load the dataset, use your data wrangling skills to clean it up, export it into:
* CSV data file;
* MySQL table.

Finally, you will need to analyze a clean dataset by querying some useful tables in MySQL.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

---


## Project Goals

During this project you will:

- Manage your own git repository.
- Build your own code from scratch.
- Put into practice the basic data processing concepts learned during the week.
- Get used to public presentations.

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* The dataset that we provide you is a significantly messy data set. Hence, select your own topic to be analyzed.
* Import the data using Pandas.
* Examine the data for potential issues.
* Apply the different cleaning and manipulation techniques you have learned.
* Produce a Jupyter Notebook that shows the steps you took and the code you used to clean and transform your data set.
* Export clean version of your data into CSV file using Pandas.
* Export clean data into MySQL using Pandas.
* Prepare at least 3 tables analyzing the dataset in MySQL. Consider using ``group by`` statement for it.
* You should also include a [README.md](./README-template.md) file that describes the steps you took and your thought process as you built your project.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **CSV file with clean data** containing the results of your data wrangling work.
* **Jupyter Notebook (data-wrangling.ipynb)** containing all Python code and commands used in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data set.
* **MySQL queries file** containing the code to obtain table of your analysis.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process followed in the importing, cleaning, manipulation, and exporting of your data as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.  Look [here](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for tips on how to structure a README.md file.

## Presentation

The presentation time limit is **5 minutes**! You will have **3 minutes** to present your project to the class and then **2 minutes** for Q&A.

The slides of your presentation must include the content listed below:

- Title of the project + Student name
- Description of your game
- Challenges
- Process
- Learnings
- If I were to start from scratch...
- Improvements
- Highlights

Tip: you have only 3 minutes for this presentation so keep it simple!

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Examine the data and come up with a deliverable** before diving in and applying any manipulation methods. Specify the specific task beforehand. You will probably spend less time on project if you specify the task and expected outcomes beforehand. Raise questions, come up with some hypotheses to be tested.
- **Break the project down into different steps** - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
- **Use the tools in your tool kit** - your knowledge of intermediate Python as well as some of the things you've learned in previous chapters. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!
- **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... *procrastinating*.
- **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
