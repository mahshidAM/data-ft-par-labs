## Project Description
The goal of this project to analyse Data with python visualization methods. For this project I used with a dataset provided by Kaggle.com (fake_real.csv).
‘Fake News’ is one of the most debated topics in the context of current political discourse across the world. In the 2016 presidential election in US, the impact of misleading ‘News’ like articles received a substantial attention, particularly after the election of President Trump.

This dataset is only a first step in understanding and tackling this problem. It contains text and metadata scraped from 244 websites tagged as "bullshit" by the BS Detector Chrome Extension by Daniel Sieradski.



## Workflow

Select Data : Select a dataset for these project that contains enough data to analyse it and visualizations.

Clean Data : Remove unuseful columns, change format, rename,...

Visualization: Try different aggregation methods and apply different visualization techniques

Export clean data to csv, save images
